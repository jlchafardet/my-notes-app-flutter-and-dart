# My Notes App

A Flutter application for managing notes.

## Features Implemented

### Step 1: Basic Notes Functionality

1. **Create a Screen to Add a New Note (Title, Content)**:
   - Users can input a title and content for a new note through a dedicated screen.

2. **Implement a List View to Display All Notes**:
   - The app displays a list of all notes that have been created, allowing users to see their notes at a glance.

3. **Add Functionality to Edit Existing Notes**:
   - Users can tap on a note to edit its title and content, making it easy to update information as needed.

### Step 2: Data Persistence with Firebase Firestore

1. **Set Up Firebase**:
   - The app is integrated with Firebase Firestore for data persistence, allowing users to save, retrieve, edit, and delete notes in real-time.

2. **CRUD Operations**:
   - Users can create new notes, read existing notes, update notes, and delete notes, all of which are reflected in Firestore.
